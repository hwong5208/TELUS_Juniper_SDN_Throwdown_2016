Nodes and Edges are availible through the api from northstar
Visulaize the topological maps

Step 2
iperf, video streaming, ping, 

Step 3
Manage the network (remember that the network is volitile)
Use tools to alter the network in near-real time, to optimize your path
 - No double links will fail, and no nodes will fail
 - 5-6 minutes for fails to heal
Optimizing due to changes
 - We provide our idea of optimizing the paths
    - Explain for each data type being sent

Step 4
Generate flows
 - React to changes in variables


We are running OSPF
    - runs all the nodes and computes paths globally/
